What does /proc/interrupts do?
  source: man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html
  This records "the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device."
  Begninning in Linux 2.6.24 , this number also includes internal
  system interrupts (i.e. not related to a device). Examples of
  system interrupts that are counted include Nonmaskable interrupt,
  Local Timer Interrupt, etc. Formatted in ASCII.

  The file has several columns.  The first column on the left is a list of IRQs
  (Interrupt Request Lines).  Then each CPU has its own column with the number
  of interrupts per IRQ it received. The next column to the right contains the
  type of interrupt, and the last column contains the name of the device that
  is located at that IRQ.

  The name of the new platform driver is "CS421 HW1".

  The "CS421 HW1" driver a IO-APIC-edge type interrupt assigned to IRQ 3.
